# furlodge-cont
FurLodge is a team project for my coding bootcamp (check it out [here](https://github.com/imbingz/fur-lodge)), an APP that connects pet owners with people(hosts) willing to take care of the pets while their owners are away and provides the hosts means to make money. I love the concept and want to continue where it was left.
